# Social_Media_API
Created an API that employs the HTTP Request/Response Cycle, through replicating similar functionalities to a social media platform. Used Python, PostgreSQL, fastapi, psycopg2, SQLAlchemy, and alembic to develop the server-side, database, and the object-relational mapper (ORM) of the application. The API replicates similar functionalities to a social media platform, in being able to create users, log them in, and allow for the logged-in users to create, delete, update, and vote on posts.
